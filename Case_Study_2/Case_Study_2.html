            <p class="society-aim"> - Wars produce refugees. People will continue to move to improve their quality of life –
               not only because of extreme poverty, but because they are connected to global culture and global networks of 
               communication. Climate change has the potential to create far greater displacement than we have seen in recent years;
                as with refugees from war, it is likely to be poorer countries who feel the greatest impact. This is a crisis that 
                cannot be solved in the near future and that is why this is a timely and a long term solution which can be tweaked easily.
